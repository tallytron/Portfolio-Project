# Portfolio-Project

In this project, I am using the COVID dataset from ourworldindata.org and understanding how the COVID cases and deaths have changed over time by looking at a series of metrics

The tools I used are SQL for data extraction and cleaning, after cleaning the data I exported it into Excel format and created a tableau dashboard.
